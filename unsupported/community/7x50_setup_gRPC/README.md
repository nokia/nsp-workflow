# NSP WFM Demo
## 7x50 Setup Telemetry

### Description
This workflow will generate all the certificates required to enable the
telemetry TLS on a Nokia SR OS device. The certificates will be copied
to the node along along the necessary configuration to enable TLS.

If certificates have been created before, hostkey and hostcert will be
reissued, copied and installed. This is used to rollout updated certs
to replace the existing ones before expiration.
